# Mad Labbers Final Project

We are "Mad Labbers", a team of budding developers attending Alchemy Code Lab in Portland, Oregon. We are in our final week of Boot Camp I. Our team has created this fun Mad Libs App together and we hope that you enjoy it!

Mad Libs is a template word game where one player picks a story theme and then enters a list of words which then are loaded into a story before reading the story aloud.
